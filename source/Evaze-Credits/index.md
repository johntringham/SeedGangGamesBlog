Evaze was made by John Tringham, working under the name Seed Gang Games. You can see what else I've been up to on this website, or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/zappablamma).

The soundtrack was made by the very talented [Thief Logic](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6VlBCFRshx9KBDfYIVz0U6?si=3hh-80KmTo2CSYbJAYhRug).

The game was made in Unity, and was originally prototyped for Ludum Dare 47 - you can play the original version in your browser for free on [itch.io](https://zb.itch.io/evaze).

The sound effects were either recorded or made using [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone), and then edited in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).

If you liked the game please remember to give it a review on the App Store/Google Play! It really helps.

If you've found a bug or have any questions please let me know! Send an email to <a href="mailto:john@seedganggames.com?subject=Evaze Bug Report">john@seedganggames.com</a> and I'll take a look and try to sort it out.

Thanks for playing!
