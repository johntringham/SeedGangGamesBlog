[Evaze](http://blog.seedganggames.com/evaze/) was made by John Tringham, working under the name Seed Gang Games. You can see what else I've been up to on this website, or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/zappablamma).

The soundtrack was made by the very talented [Thief Logic](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6VlBCFRshx9KBDfYIVz0U6?si=3hh-80KmTo2CSYbJAYhRug).

Big special thanks to everyone who played and gave feedback on the original Ludum Dare prototype, especially [Randomise User](https://youtu.be/fTj2jiC6yZM?t=592) for including it in their youtube series!

The game was made in Unity, and was originally prototyped for Ludum Dare 47 - you can play the original version in your browser for free on [itch.io](https://zb.itch.io/evaze).

The sound effects were either recorded or made using [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone), and then edited in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).

If you liked the game please remember to give it a review on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/evaze/id1622609861)/[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.johntringham.Evaze)! It really helps.
