Evaze was made by John Tringham, working under the name Seed Gang Games. You can see what else I've been up to on this website, or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/zappablamma).

The soundtrack was made by the very talented [Thief Logic](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6VlBCFRshx9KBDfYIVz0U6?si=3hh-80KmTo2CSYbJAYhRug).

Tester/advisers/patient friends:

The game was made in Unity, and was originally prototyped for Ludum Dare 47 - you can play this version in your browser for free on [itch.io](https://zb.itch.io/evaze).

The sound effects were either recorded or made using [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone), and then edited in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).

Thanks for playing!
