I made a game for 7DFPS about the social interactions that happen when playing a couch co-op game.

You play a zombie shooter with your buddy, and the actions you take in the game affect the dialog that happens between you two.

The game got featured on [Warp Door](https://warpdoor.com/2021/01/11/two-player/) and [Alpha Beta Gamer](https://www.alphabetagamer.com/two-player-game-jam-build/), and even got on [Game-Curator's Game Jam Games of the Year List](https://game-curator.com/miscellaneous/goty-game-jam-edition/goty-2020-game-jam-edition/)! 

I'm very surprised by the reaction to it and the kind comments, it's really nice.

I also wrote a postmortem blogpost on itch.io [here](https://zb.itch.io/two-player/devlog/205046/problems-i-ran-into-while-making-two-player), if you want to read me rambling on too long about some of the design decisions.

Made in Unity using [Doodle Studio 95](https://fernandoramallo.itch.io/doodle-studio-95) to create the sprites.
