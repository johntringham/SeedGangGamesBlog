I set up this blog here for tech / video game stuff. I'm using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) which is pretty nice, and [Surge](http://surge.sh), which is amazing. The theme is based on [Frame](https://github.com/zoeingwingkei/frame/), but I've modified it a bit.

The cool thing about Hexo is that you write all posts locally as markdown files, and then Hexo generates a full blog made out of just static webpages, including tags, archives, etc - which means you don't need a big fancy CMS or webserver or anything. And because the blog is just made out of static pages, you can host it with something simple like Surge.

I've backdated a couple of posts to create the illusion I've had this blog for a while.

Next step is to add analytics - probably going to be using self-hosted [Plausible](https://plausible.io) because [Google Analytics feels a bit spywary](https://www.cnil.fr/en/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers-united-states-cnil-orders-website-manageroperator-comply) at the moment.
