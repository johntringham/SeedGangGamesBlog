I've been digging through some old prototypes recently - here's a video of a zoo management game I spent a few days on:

By the time I called it quits, it had about 6 different animals, fence placement, different terrain types, individual species having preferences for specific terrain types, and some other stuff. Not 100% sure why I made it but I did. Maybe I'll come back to it in the future.

My favourite bit about the whole this is still the penguin design:
