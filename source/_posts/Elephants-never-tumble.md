Here's a dumb game I made for Ludum Dare, where you stack items ontop of an elephant balancing over a gourge.

Made in one and a half days solo, because I was stupid and decided to change game idea halfway through the three day challenge. Still liked the end result though.

Graphics were hand drawn using the amazing [Doodle Studio 95](https://fernandoramallo.itch.io/doodle-studio-95). Made in Unity, and should work in modern desktop browsers (sorry, no mobile support). The gameplay was my girlfriends idea (she's much better at game jam ideas than me)
