I'm happy to announce that I (finally) released Evaze!

Evaze was originally a Ludum Dare entry from a couple of years ago, and I revamped it, spiced it up, and made it a proper game.

It's a fast-paced puzzle-action game where you slide rows and columns of a maze around in order to get around, while avoiding the bad guys.

It's a simple and fun little mobile game that you can download for free!! That's right FREE

It's my first independant commercial game - a relatively small game, but I like it a lot.
